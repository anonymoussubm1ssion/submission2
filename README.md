# An Empirical Study on LLM-based Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection: Can it Really Work?

This repository includes the dataset, the supplemented vulnerability definitions to selected methods, and the source code of the optimized model.

## Dataset
Please find the smart contracts in [dataset](dataset) folder, and the carefully-labeled vulnerabilities are stored in a JSON file [here](vulnerabilities.json).

 ## Supplemented Content Vulnerability Definitions
The Supplemented vulnerability definitions for selected methods and prompts used in stage 3 of the optimized method are stored in [prompt](prompt) folder.

## License
Some of the contracts in [dataset](dataset) folder that are obtained from public websites retain their original licenses. Other files in this repository are for peer review only.
